# **DAN104** <font size="4">Advanced Building Science</font>
##### Master of Architecture @ [QUT](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/faculty-of-engineering/school-of-architecture-and-built-environment)<br>
<br>
Buildings are major energy consumers, and most of that energy is used during operation. With finite resources, it's crucial for architects to understand the environmental impact of their design decisions. This unit aims to help future architects develop the scientific knowledge and practical skills they need to create sustainable, high-performing buildings.<br>
<br>
Through hands-on activities and simulations, we aimed to introduce students to natural ways of controlling indoor conditions for maximum comfort and minimal energy consumption. We encouraged them to explore the role of building science and simulation tools in designing sustainable buildings, and supported students learning how to evaluate and optimize their design solutions. In a world of continuosly developing technology, the combination of profound theoretical building science knowledge and advanced software skills will help students enhancing their skillset for their future career in the built environment.<br>
