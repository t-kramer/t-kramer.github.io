abstract = {This thesis explores how recent technological trends such as low-cost hardware, data science and AI can be used to improve and personalise thermal comfort modelling. It integrates the design of a personal thermal comfort monitoring device, a longitudinal field study and the development of a new framework for data-driven and personalised long-term thermal comfort modelling. The study underscores the importance of accommodating individual preferences and spatial variations in dynamic indoor environments and offers a new perspective on the integration of open-source technologies, data-driven methodologies, and AI in rethinking the role of thermal comfort in contemporary building design.},

	abstract = {Despite substantial evidence emphasising the diversity in thermal comfort perception, conventional models like the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index tend to overlook personal variability. In buildings, this oversight leads to occupant discomfort, dissatisfaction, and inefficient energy use for conditioning. In the past, technological and logistical constraints made personalised field studies an arduous task. However, today recent advancements in low-cost sensor technology allow one to pervasively capture the immediate and personal thermal environment experienced by building occupants. Between summer and winter 2022, we conducted a field study across 13 office buildings in Brisbane, Australia, investigating the personal variability in thermal comfort perception. Throughout the study, we recorded over 135,000 samples of continuous personal indoor environmental data at participants' workspaces and collected 813 occupant survey responses. Analysing the data, we found (1) significant personal variability between subjects, evident in a personal mean discrepancy from the PMV index ranging from −1.5 to +1.5 on the thermal comfort scale; (2) a limited accuracy of the PMV index ranging between 35 and 40\%; when predicting the subject’s thermal sensation vote, (3) offices with highly heterogeneous thermal indoor environments; (4) dissatisfaction with the workspace due to thermal discomfort and insufficient control of the personal thermal environment. Our findings suggest a high personal and spatial variability in thermal comfort, underscoring the need to consider these factors to improve the accuracy and occupant-focus of thermal comfort indices.},

  abbr={E&B},
  abstract = {In a new era of indoor environmental monitoring, the combination of cost-effectiveness and reasonable accuracy makes low-cost sensors a valuable tool for thermal comfort research. Unfortunately, steep learning curves, the complexity of calibration methods and insufficient documentation on existing devices prevent most of the research community from benefiting from these exciting technological advancements. While previous work has focused on substantiating the effectiveness and accuracy of low-cost units, little has been done to actively share the knowledge and enable more widespread use of low-cost sensors. Through an iterative design process, we developed the climateBOX, an open-source thermal comfort monitoring unit for less than 50 US$. The simplistic design, a streamlined calibration method and comprehensive documentation, including step-by-step instructions hosted by an open-access platform, make the climateBOX especially suitable for inexperienced users seeking an entry point to the field of low-cost monitoring technology. Comprehensive testing of sensor-to-sensor error, accuracy and long-term use of 15 units in the field, revealed the devices' high accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, based on the results from our analysis, we developed a simplified, single-point calibration method that removes an often-considerable barrier to the pervasive implementation of such units in the field and allows to build and use the unit without the need for expensive reference equipment. The climateBOX and the associated open-source platform will enable the pervasive collection of thermal comfort data in greater quantity and variety and will significantly facilitate widespread access to low-cost comfort monitoring technology throughout the whole research community.},

  abstract ={This paper presents preliminary findings from a thermal comfort field study using low-cost monitoring equipment in Brisbane, Australia. The study involves the collection of occupant feedback and indoor climate data from five different air-conditioned office buildings. Analysing the collected data, it was found that the PMV model partially overestimates thermal sensations indicated by participants. The field study methodology based on low-cost equipment was found to be reliable and user-convenient and can facilitate the collection of more thermal comfort data. This will open new ways to comfort modelling by integrating emergingtechnologies like AI and Data Science into comfort prediction workflows.},

  abstract ={This paper presents an alternative workflow for thermal comfort prediction. By using the leverage of Data Science & AI in combination with the power of computational design, the proposed methodology exploits the extensive comfort data provided by the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II to generate more customised comfort prediction models. These models consider additional, often significant input parameters like location and specific building characteristics. Results from an early case study indicate that such an approach has the potential for more accurate comfort predictions that eventually lead to more efficient and comfortable buildings.},
